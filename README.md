# AndroidTestWorkshop
## Introduction
Welcome to the Test Automation Workshop in Android. In this workshop we will cover 4 parts of the test pyramid.
1. Junit + MVP
2. Robolectric
3. Espresso
4. Black box tests

## Setup
1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. Use the command to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/phellipealexandre/AndroidTestWorkshop.git`
3. Switch to the tag that corresponds to the first part of the workshop: `git checkout pt1`
4. Create an emulator in AVD Manager in Android Studio or enable the developer configuration in a real device
5. Run the project on the emulator/device

## Description of the project
The project has four **tags,** each one of them representing one type of test
* `pt1: ` JUnit + MVP
* `pt2: ` Robolectric
* `pt3: ` Espresso
* `pt4: ` Black box tests with UI Automator

Each tag has a branch with the proposed solution:
* `Pt1Solution`: Unit Tests with MVP implemented
* `Pt2Solution`: Robolectric implemented
* `Pt3Solution`: Espresso implemented
* `master`: All test solution implemented

## Disclaimer
The proposed solutions are not perfect because the ideia of the workshop is to analyse the trade-off between all testing solutions. 
The main goal is to explore together with everybody participating in the workshop.

## Feedback
